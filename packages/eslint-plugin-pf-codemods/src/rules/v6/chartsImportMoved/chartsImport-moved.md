### chartsImport-moved [(#11091)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-react/pull/11091)

In order to support multiple chart libraries, Victory based charts have moved. This rule will update import paths to our victory directory.

Additionally, Victory has become a peer dependency.

#### Examples

In:

```jsx
%inputExample%
```

Out:

```jsx
%outputExample%
```
